## First Visit

I'm usually a hot coffee person, but a windy evening on the way to a friend's place led me to Momonoki, and I'm glad it did. I also sampled their hot chocolate, not too sweet, with a beautiful silky froth—but the iced coffee stole the show.

## The Iced Coffee

I went with brown sugar and whole milk, and the balance was perfect. The sweetness was just right, the ice-to-liquid ratio was spot-on, and the coffee itself was smooth and well-prepared. The cup held a generous 300ml, which made the $4.50 price point a good value.

## The One Drawback

My only complaint: once you secure the lid, it's surprisingly difficult to push a straw through without it becoming unstable. I had a few spills before getting the technique right, something worth knowing before your first visit!

## Recommendation

Despite the minor lid quirk, Momonoki deserves a visit. Their iced coffee is genuinely one of the best I've had recently, and the cozy atmosphere makes it worth going back. Definitely planning a return trip.
