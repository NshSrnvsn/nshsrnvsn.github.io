## My Journey

Japan was an unforgettable experience with vibrant cities, serene temples, and incredible food.

### Tokyo
The energy in Tokyo is unmatched—from Shibuya crossing to quiet shrines hidden in the city.

### Kyoto
Kyoto's traditional temples and bamboo forests felt like stepping back in time.

### Highlights
- Golden Pavilion at sunrise
- Street food in Osaka
- Hiking Mount Fuji
