  What is happening at Willow's Creek?

<div class="poem">

I hear something, it is loud, but calming.  
It is nice, this sound. It distracts my thoughts. I am annoyed by it, yet somehow soothed.  
This sound has always been there. Always this loud. Always this calming. But in my head, the noises were too loud to notice.

It brings with it a gush of things, this sound. A gush of happiness. A gush of wind. A gush of dust.  
And with it, a gush of decay, carried along like something forgotten rather than something seen.

Still, the sound is soothing. I want to hear it longer. I want it to stay.  
When it stops, the absence is worse than the noise ever was.  
Deafen me again. Do not stop.

I want to hear it more,  
this sound of rustling leaves.
