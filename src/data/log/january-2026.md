## What I've Been Up To

Started the year by finally building out my personal website with Astro. It's been a fun journey learning the framework and customizing everything to my liking.

### Recent Highlights

- Finished the Archives section with travel stories, reviews, and paintings gallery
- Experimenting with new matcha recipes (the ceremonial grade one is definitely worth it!)
- Planning a spring trip to Japan - can't wait to visit Kyoto during cherry blossom season

### Currently Reading

"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle" by Haruki Murakami. The surrealist elements are beautifully woven into everyday life in Tokyo.

### Goals for This Month

- Add more travel stories from past trips
- Write reviews for my favorite local coffee shops
- Start painting again (been too long!)

Looking forward to documenting more of life's moments here. ✨
